# Nexus Linguarum network graph

Nexus Linguarum organizes various events and is continuing to build a community. At [EUROLAN-2021](https://nexuslinguarum.eu/project/eurolan-2021-training-school-on-linked-data-for-linguistics/), we began to provide some information on that in machine-readable form, as RDF and/or OWL, and plan to continue to do so, to be used, for example, as illustrator of LOD technology.
